# PlantPlanner

PlantPlanner is a small application to schedule the watering days of your plants at home. You can give your plants names, select their watering days and how much water do they need.

## Requirements

- Qt 5.14+ ( A lower Qt5 version can also be okay but it is not tested with the Qt versions below 5.14)
- Qt Creator

## Installation 

- MacOs
  In the source files, there is a .dmg file which can be used directly to setup the application.

- Windows / Linux
  You can run and deploy the project directly from the Qt Creator. For detailed information about deploying an application from Qt Creator, please refer to this [link](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/deployment.html).

## Future Work

- Currently working on the embedded version of the application in Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.
- When the embedded version is completed, with the help of humidity sensors, more in-depth tracking is planned.
